# 🚀 Point of Rental — AI Quote Copilot

### “Are you tired of manually reading every customer email, typing it into POR, and building quotes line by line?”
### Well, now you don’t have to.

Meet AI Quote Copilot — an autonomous quoting system built for Point of Rental, inspired by HumanLayer’s philosophy of agentic automation.
It reads what customers write, understands it like a human, applies pricing logic, and generates a ready-to-review quote — instantly.

# 🧠 The Vision

At Point of Rental, your Customer Service Reps (CSRs) spend hours daily turning unstructured messages into structured rental quotes.

#### What if an AI could do that for them - instantly, consistently, and 24/7?

That’s what this project proves:
A HumanLayer-style AI Operator, trained for the rental domain, that handles the first 80% of quote generation before a human even touches it.

POR could deploy this as an internal Copilot - directly augmenting your existing workflow.
